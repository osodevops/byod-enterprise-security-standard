OSO DevOps is committed to maintaining the security of client data and 
financial assets, protecting them against unauthorised access or modification, 
malicious or accidental disclosure and/or destruction in order to maintain its 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## BYOD Objective
This standard outlines the security requirements required to protect 
your organisational data and financial assets (including systems, 
applications and infrastructure) against improper 
or unauthorised access that could result in compromise of 
confidentiality, integrity or availability of your data via the use 
of bring your own devices (BYOD).

The BYOD Security Standard addresses the minimum set of controls 
required to ensure all that BYOD are adequately protected to 
reduce risk from weaknesses in hardware and software and 
protected against information disclosure in case of loss or theft.

## Scope of Standard
This standard applies to all employees in all geographical locations, 
and to all subsidiaries and joint ventures in which your organisation 
has a controlling interest (except where local laws and/or regulatory 
requirements explicitly preclude specific activities defined herein). 
It applies to all instances where your organisational data is accessed, 
processed or stored whether or not this use takes place in an office 
or in a cloud environment.

This standard does not supersede any local or regional laws, government 
regulations, or other legislative or contractual requirements.

## Definitions of Standard
Throughout this Security Standard, controls are written using `MUST`, 
`SHOULD` and `MAY`. Where these are present, they are defined as follows:
- Controls that use ***MUST*** require mandatory compliance.
- Controls that use ***SHOULD*** are considered recommendations that will further enhance
security.
- Controls that use ***MAY*** give permission to perform a specific action.

## BYOD System Controls
To ensure the protection of information in networks and systems and the 
protection of the supporting infrastructure, the minimum set of control 
requirements are defined as:
1. Connectivity of all personal mobile devices is centrally managed by a 
Corporate Facilities team, who must approve a device 
before it can be connected to our systems. Devices are not permitted to 
connect to corporate infrastructure without documented consent from the 
Corporate Facilities team.
2. No one is required to use their personal mobile device for business purposes. 
It is a matter entirely for each person’s discretion.
3. The use of a personal device in connection with organisational data is a 
privilege granted to employees through approval from their line manager 
and from the Corporate Facilities team.
4. The organisation has no obligation to modify systems to assist staff 
in connecting to our systems. The organisation is not responsible for 
technical support of a personal device.
5. The organisation reserves the right to revoke these privileges in the 
event that staff do not abide by the policies and procedures set out herein 
or otherwise where, in our reasonable opinion a device is being or could be 
used in a way that puts, or could put, the organisation, its staff, its 
business connections, the organisation’s systems or its company data at risk.
6. Staff connecting personal mobile devices to the organisation's systems must 
not loan their device out to anyone.
7. Corporate Facilities reserves the right to disable or disconnect some or 
all services without prior notification.

9. Users of personal mobile devices are not eligible for expense reimbursement 
for any hardware or carrier services from the organisation.
10. Corporate Facilities require security software to be placed on personal 
mobile devices to enable to connectivity to the organisation infrastructure.

## BYOD Exceptions
It is vital that the business requirements for agility and change are balanced with the need for security. 
Exceptions, both temporary and permanent, to security controls, standards, processes or policies must be managed in a 
controlled and transparent process to reduce risk while maintaining flexibility. The objectives of this section are defined as:
    - To minimise the risk that an exception to one of the controls stated within this security standard adversely impacts the organisation’s execution of business process.
    - To minimise the risk that an exception to one of the controls stated within this security standard adversely impacts the organisation’s cyber and security risk profile.
    - To ensure a complete oversight of all exceptions through adequate and documented process (including. logging and monitoring of exceptions).

***Exceptions to this standard require:***
1. A formal request MUST be raised with the organisation’s security team when the business have reasons to believe an exception to a control stated within this BYOD security standard.
2. The organisation’s security teams ***MUST*** acknowledge receipt of the request, and advise the requestor of the timescale for review and approval.
3. The organisation’s security teams with the assistance of any SME as required MUST assess the security risks related to the exception, and advise the requestor on plausible mitigation factors.
